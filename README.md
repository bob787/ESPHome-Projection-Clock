# ESPHome-Projection-Clock
I built a day/night projection clock built on an ESP32 with ESPHome. The projector is lit by a high-power LED driven by a constant-current board controlled with a PWM signal from the ESP32. The light is directed through a collimator, a color TFT display, and a focusing lens
